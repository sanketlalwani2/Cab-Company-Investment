## Introduction

The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the cab industry using data from various sources. The analysis includes data cleaning, merging, feature engineering, and generating insights.

## Dataset

The datasets used in this analysis are:

1. **Cab Data:** Information about each cab ride, including distance traveled, price charged, and cost of the trip.
2. **City Data:** Population and number of users for different cities.
3. **Customer Data:** Demographic information about customers.
4. **Transaction Data:** Payment details for each transaction.
5. **Holiday Data:** Dates of holidays.

The datasets were sourced from Kaggle.

## Installation

To run the analysis, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

```
## Usage

The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook. To run the notebook:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook by running `jupyter notebook` in your terminal.
4. Open the `Cab Industry Analysis.ipynb` notebook and run the cells sequentially.

## Analysis

The analysis includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading:** Importing datasets using pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and correcting data types.
3. **Data Merging:** Combining different datasets for a comprehensive view.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features like profit, profit percentage, and users' percentage.
5. **Data Visualization:** Generating plots to visualize the data and derive insights.

## Results

The analysis provided insights into:

- Average profit per trip.
- Cities with the highest and lowest number of users.
- Distribution of trip costs and prices.
- Impact of holidays on cab usage.
